		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The idea here is to create a game in the vein of <a href="adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com">A Dark Room</a>. That
		is, something incremental that develops as the player progesses, but with multiplayer elements. Players will be given
		a small group of critters which they must breed to collect resources from a private pool. Once a certain level of
		development is reached, players will then gain access to a common pool of resources that speed development. Drawing
		from this pool forms a tragedy of the commons which will be the core hook of the game, can players collaborate to
		share in the gains?  Or will the strongest muscle out all competition?</p>
		
		<p>For the technology side of things, this game will run primarily in the player's browser for the core game loop
		(breed critters to collect more resources to breed better critters), but with asynchonous elements when users
		draw from the common pool, trade, or attack each other. The game will also include a rudementary chat client to 
		aid communication.</p>
		
		<p>We designed this project as a sort of ladder, with a very simple-to-implement core mechanic that should meet the
		minimum project requirements and many optional add ons which we can make once we've built the core. Hopefully this
		means that we will accomplish as much as we can without taking on too much.</p>
